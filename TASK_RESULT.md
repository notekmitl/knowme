Status: **DRAFT PR OPEN — local gates passed**

Date: 2026-08-24

Branch: `codex/thai-report-reader-experience-v2`

Base: `58b1d742f7a00ef9c882c1fad2357dbcf08f3ad0`

Implementation commit: `2f59602867c6ce5c53bd76d00efe2645121e7d68`

Draft PR: https://github.com/notekmitl/knowme/pull/106

## Implemented

- Web, dedicated PDF and browser print use the same four-part reader order.
- The infographic follows `แนวโน้ม 12 เดือนข้างหน้า` and displays the exact
  rolling range, such as `7 ส.ค. 2569 – 6 ส.ค. 2570`.
- `monthlyTimelineAvailable=false`; no monthly, good-month or caution-month
  predictions were added.
- The 360×640 logical infographic exports at 1080×1920 with a denser,
  readable layout and explicit Known/Unknown limitations.
- Candidate-only Thai copy repair improves headings and reflection prompts;
  accepted R1–R7.1 canonical output remains exact.

## Validation evidence

- Patch SHA-256:
  `E93DED06A9633AD1A877EFDA8B3DD56A9F68554DF23645AA316569D2141C7496`.
- Dart format: 15 changed Dart files formatted successfully.
- Focused commands: 91/91, 1/1, 38/38 and 3/3 passed.
- 300-profile audit: 300/300 profiles, 4,884 changed fields; omission,
  addition, semantic, prediction/advice and traceability impacts all 0.
- Required full suite: 1,618/1,618 passed in 5:07.
- Analyzer: exit 0 with 298 non-fatal baseline warnings/infos.
- Surface QA: Known/Unknown at widths 360 and 390 exported deterministic
  1080×1920 PNGs; each width pair is byte-identical for the same evidence
  mode. All four outputs were opened and inspected with no clipping, overlap,
  overflow or accidental blank region.
- Dedicated PDF QA: Known 9 pages, Unknown 8 pages. All 17 rendered pages were
  inspected; no blank page, clipping, overlap or broken section order.
- Browser-print QA from real headless Chrome: Known 7 pages, Unknown 7 pages.
  All 14 rendered pages were inspected; no blank page, clipping or overflow.
- PDF/browser-print order and forbidden-title verification passed. Chrome's
  embedded Thai font is not extractable by pdfplumber, so browser order was
  verified against the exact generated HTML plus every-page raster inspection.
- Accepted canonical/live-as-of, R7.1 exact owner-unknown and 300-case semantic
  safety gates passed inside the required suite.
- Changed-path audit found no Thai Engine, Canon, calculations, ascendant,
  houses, Thai-day basis, life-period boundaries, Auth, Firebase or
  `product-acceptance/` changes.

## Git and release state

- Repository PreCommit: passed (scope, forbidden scan, analyzer, all focused
  commands and required full suite).
- Repository PostCommit: passed for the implementation commit.
- Branch pushed and Draft PR #106 opened against `main`.
- GitHub reports `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, but `statusCheckRollup=[]` and no
  Actions run exists for the branch. There are therefore no configured/reported
  GitHub checks to wait for or truthfully call green.
- Merge, deployment and Firebase/Production mutation: not performed and out of
  scope.
